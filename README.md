# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The our main goal with our analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In our previous analysis we looked at the ride count, average fare per ride, and average number of drivers, all categorized by the type of city. Additionally, we compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. For this challenge, we created a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.


## Results

From this summary chart we can see how there is a trend between how populated a city is and the total number of rides. This directly affects the total number of drivers, total fare, and both averages. The total number of rides, drivers, and fares decrase as the cities become farther from urbanized areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This is because of the accessibility of PyBer rides and drivers in rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas will may lead to a higher average fare per ride and driver, as prices increase when supply is low.

By analyzing the chart we are able to compare total fares by city type over a period of five months. The number of rides seem peak at the end of February and fluctuates during the month of March. All three graphs tend to follow the same trend during these months, for suburban cities there is a higher increase during the month of April.

## Summary
Since the total fare by city type seems to increase during the month of April in suburban cities, the company should research as to what causes this increase, especially because the total fare decreases for other types of cities. We also know that the average fare per ride and driver is higher when there are less drivers. The company can change ride-share prices by limiting or increasing the number of drivers during a certain time to achieve its profit goal. Also the average fare per ride shows a gradual increase from more populated cites to less populated cities. However, the average fare per drive increases drastically when following the same trend. This indicates that the number of drivers may be exponentially lower than expected. The company may want to allocate more drivers to rural areas to optimize its profits.
